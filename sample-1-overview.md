# Sample 1: Process document

## üíº Project title

### Runbook creation process for existing business services

## üìÇ Context

In my previous role as a Technical Writer, I proposed a new process for the client's IT department. I also created an accompanying document describing how to implement the process from start to end. 

I decided to write a high-level process document loosely inspired by that project. This document is *not* meant to be detailed or demonstrate an in-depth understanding of ITSM (IT Service Management) or ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) best practices. Instead, I've created it to provide an insight into my writing abilities. I tried to keep it short and straightforward.

For my first writing sample, I wrote a process document for Pentagon Health, a fictional healthcare company in the Philippines. They have several existing business services but no documents explaining how the IT teams and operators run them. Pentagon Health hired Technical Writers to fill in the gap.

To jumpstart the documentation process, a Senior Technical Writer drafts a process document detailing how to create a business service runbook. It establishes a standard operating procedure for preparing the runbook and will serve as a reference for other Technical Writers.

## üë• Target audience

The target audience of this process document is Pentagon Health's current and future Technical Writers. It serves as their onboarding guide for creating a process runbook for existing business services.

The document also orients other IT teams on their involvement in the runbook creation process, especially the help, materials, and deliverables they need to provide.

# Runbook creation process for existing business services

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a step-by-step process of the runbook creation process for Pentagon Health‚Äôs existing business services. 
As a Technical Writer for Pentagon Health‚Äôs Information Technology (IT) department, you will own the runbook creation process for a specific business service. This process document covers the planning stage up until the approval stage.

Some of Pentagon Health‚Äôs business services already have available documentation, while others do not have any. You will either have to gather additional information or build the runbook from scratch. You must collaborate with the Application Owner, Business Analyst, Software Developer(s), Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and different teams to obtain all necessary information. You will also work with them to verify the runbook‚Äôs clarity, consistency, accuracy, accessibility, and usability.

## Before you begin

### Assumptions

This process document has the following assumptions:

* You are familiar with Pentagon Health‚Äôs organizational structure and IT operations.
* You have a working knowledge of IT Service Management (ITSM) and IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL).
* You have a general understanding of Pentagon Health‚Äôs business services, including what they are and what they do.
* You know what a business service runbook is and what it does, especially in the context of Pentagon Health‚Äôs business goals and IT operations. You must be familiar with the technical terms used in the runbook template.
* The team assigned to a business service consists of an Application Owner, a Business Analyst, and Software Developers.
* Technical Writers are only responsible for the planning stage to the approval stage. Afterward, the assignment is handed over to the Release Manager (for deployment) and to the Application Owner (for maintenance).
* The Application Owner is in charge of updating and maintaining the business service runbook.
Make sure that you have already finished and understood Pentagon Health‚Äôs onboarding guide for new hires before doing this assignment. When in doubt, approach your Team Lead.

### Limitations

This document has the following limitations:
* The process document only applies to *existing* business services. In other words, it is not applicable to business services that are currently under development or still in the planning stage. There is a separate runbook creation process for new business services.
* The process document only covers the planning stage up until the approval stage. The succeeding stages‚Äìthe deployment and maintenance stages‚Äìare outlined in other process documents. The deployment and maintenance of the runbook will be the responsibilities of the Release Manager and the Application Owner, respectively.

### About this task
Runbooks are reference documents describing how to operate Pentagon Health‚Äôs business services. They include technical specifications, operational procedures, checklists, disaster recovery plans, and other related documents and reference materials.

Runbooks are created for one of the following reasons:

* Experienced operators document their daily tasks and share their knowledge in runbooks. It ensures that their know-how is not merely stored in their brains, but can be shared between all operators and passed on to future team members.
* Runbooks serve as an onboarding guide for new operators or team members who will be assigned to a specific business service. 
* Runbooks eliminate the need for memorizing multiple steps and complex processes. Operators only need to consult the runbook if they need to perform a task, resulting in an efficient and successful implementation.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Plan
The planning stage involves setting initial discovery meetings with the team, reviewing existing documentation, and preparing checklists for a smooth execution of the information gathering and writing phases.

Each of Pentagon Health‚Äôs existing business services is assigned to a specific team, which typically consists of an Application Owner, a Business Analyst, and Software Developers. Other business services may require more specialists, but these individuals are the core team members. They run, monitor, and update the business service, and will be your key contact persons during the runbook creation process. 

## Step 1.1: Set a meeting with the team

1. Know the names and contact information of the team members in charge of the business service.
2. Reach out to these key individuals. In your message, briefly introduce yourself and your new assignment. Schedule an initial discovery call or meeting with the team so you can learn more about the business service.
3. During the meeting, be proactive in taking notes and asking questions. You should have a better understanding of the business service after the discussion.
4. Ask the team if the business service has existing documentation, such as user guides, operating manuals, system reference manuals, service level agreements, and many more. Request a copy of these documents, and any other reference materials related to the business service. They might come in handy later on.

> üí° **Tips**
> * The goal of the initial discovery meeting is for you to have a working knowledge of the business service. The team may provide a process or application walkthrough, presentation, or seminar.
> * If possible, try to learn as much as you can about the business service before the meeting. However, there is always information available online.
> * Draft some questions before the meeting.
> * You can also record the meeting if you prefer. Do not forget to ask for permission beforehand.
