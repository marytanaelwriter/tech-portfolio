# Sample 1: Process document

## üíº Project title

### Runbook creation process for existing business services

## üìÇ Context

In my previous role as a Technical Writer, I proposed a new process for the client's IT department. I also created an accompanying document describing how to implement the process from start to end. 

I decided to write a high-level process document loosely inspired by that project. This document is *not* meant to be detailed or demonstrate an in-depth understanding of ITSM (IT Service Management) or ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) best practices. Instead, I've created it to provide an insight into my writing abilities. I tried to keep it short and straightforward.

For my first writing sample, I wrote a process document for Pentagon Health, a fictional healthcare company in the Philippines. They have several existing business services but no documents explaining how the IT teams and operators run them. Pentagon Health hired Technical Writers to fill in the gap.

To jumpstart the documentation process, a Senior Technical Writer drafts a process document detailing how to create a business service runbook. It establishes a standard operating procedure for preparing the runbook and will serve as a reference for other Technical Writers.

## üë• Target audience

The target audience of this process document is Pentagon Health's current and future Technical Writers. It serves as their onboarding guide for creating a process runbook for existing business services.

The document also orients other IT teams on their involvement in the runbook creation process, especially the help, materials, and deliverables they need to provide.
