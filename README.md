# Welcome to my tech writing portfolio~

Hello!

Thank you for your interest, and for taking the time to review my technical writing portfolio.

Here’s a quick background about me: I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Creative Writing. I have over three years of experience in content writing and copywriting, and less than a year of experience in technical writing. 

In my previous role as a Technical Writer, I signed a nondisclosure agreement so I can’t share any of my works. Since I only have blog articles and marketing write-ups to show, I decided to create a technical writing portfolio to facilitate my transition to the IT industry.

My writing samples include a process document, an installation guide, a how-to guide, a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page, and a video script.
I hope that my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills. Please check my [online CV](marytanaelwriter.com) or LinkedIn profile to learn more about my qualifications.

Thank you!
Mary
