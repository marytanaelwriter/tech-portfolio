## 📄🖊️💻✨ Mary's Technical Writing Portfolio

Hello!

Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my technical writing portfolio.

Here is some quick info about me: I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Creative Writing. I have over four years of experience in content writing, copywriting, technical writing, and editing. (More about me [here](about-me.md).)

Since I recently transitioned to the IT industry, my tech writing experience is limited. I also signed a nondisclosure agreement in my previous role as a Technical Writer, so I can’t share any of my works. To address these gaps, I decided to create this portfolio.

My writing samples include a process document, an installation guide, and a how-to guide. I’m currently working on a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page and a video script, and I plan to include them here once I finish.

[Sample 1: Process document](sample-1-overview.md)  
[Sample 2: Installation guide](sample-2-overview.md)  
[Sample 3: How-to guide](sample-3-overview.md)  

I hope that my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills. Please check my [online CV](https://marytanaelwriter.com) or [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marytanaelwriter) to learn more about my qualifications.

Thank you!

Mary
