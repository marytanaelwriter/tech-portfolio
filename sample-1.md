## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the runbook creation process for Pentagon Health's existing business services.

As a Technical Writer for Pentagon Health's Information Technology (IT) department, you will own the runbook creation process for a specific business service. This process document starts with planning and ends with the approval stage. 

You are accountable for the content development process, which means that you will be setting timelines and deadlines for every stage. These will be monitored and approved by your Team Lead.

Some of Pentagon Health's existing business services already have available documentation, while others do not. You will have to gather additional information or help build the data from scratch. To do this, you must collaborate with the Application Owner, Business Analyst, Software Developer(s), Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and other internal teams. You will also work with them to verify the runbook's clarity, consistency, accuracy, accessibility, and usability.

## Before you begin

### Assumptions

This process document has the following assumptions:

- You are familiar with Pentagon Health's organizational structure and IT operations.
- You have a working knowledge of IT Service Management (ITSM) and IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL).
- You have a general understanding of Pentagon Health's business services, including what they are and what they do.
- You know what a business service runbook is and what it does, especially in the context of Pentagon Health's business goals and IT operations. You must be familiar with the technical terms used in the runbook template.
- The team assigned to a business service consists of an Application Owner, a Business Analyst, and Software Developers.
- Technical Writers are only responsible for the planning and approval stages. Once approved, you will hand over the runbook to the Release Manager (for deployment) and the Application Owner (for maintenance).
- The Application Owner is in charge of updating and maintaining the business service runbook.

Before this assignment, ensure you have already finished and understood Pentagon Health's Onboarding Guide for New Employees. When in doubt, approach your Team Lead.

### Limitations

This process document has the following limitations:

- The process document only applies to *existing* business services. In other words, it does not apply to business services currently under development or in the planning stage. There is a separate runbook creation process for new business services.
- The process document only covers the planning stage until the approval stage. The succeeding stages–the deployment and maintenance stages–are outlined in other process documents. The deployment and maintenance of the runbook will be the responsibilities of the Release Manager and the Application Owner, respectively.

### About this task

Runbooks are reference documents describing how to operate Pentagon Health's business services. They include technical specifications, operational procedures, checklists, disaster recovery plans, and other related documents and reference materials.

Runbooks are created for one of the following reasons:

- Experienced operators document their daily tasks and share their knowledge in runbooks. It ensures that their know-how is not merely stored in their brains but can be shared between all operators and passed on to future team members.
- Runbooks serve as an onboarding guide for new operators or team members who will be assigned to a specific business service.
- Runbooks eliminate the need for memorizing multiple steps and complex processes. Operators only need to consult the runbook if they need to perform a task, resulting in an efficient and successful implementation.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Plan

The planning stage involves:
- Setting initial discovery meetings with the team,
- Reviewing existing documentation, and 
- Preparing checklists for smooth execution of the information gathering and writing phases.

Pentagon Health's existing business services are assigned to a specific team, which typically consists of an Application Owner, a Business Analyst, and Software Developers. Other business services may require more specialists, but these individuals are the core team members. They run, monitor, and update the business service and will be your key contact persons during the runbook creation process.

#### Step 1.1: Set a meeting with the team

1. Know the names and contact information of the team members in charge of the business service.
2. Reach out to the team via email. In your message, briefly introduce yourself and your new assignment. Schedule an initial discovery call or meeting with the team so you can learn more about the business service.
3. During the meeting, be proactive in taking notes and asking questions. You must have a better understanding of the business service after the discussion.
4. Ask the team if the business service has documentation, such as user guides, operating manuals, system reference manuals, service level agreements, and many more. Request a copy of these documents and any other reference materials related to the business service. 

>  💡 **Tips**
>
> - The initial discovery meeting aims to give you working knowledge of the business service. The team may provide a process or application walkthrough, presentation, or seminar to achieve this objective.
> - If possible, try to learn as much as you can about the business service before the meeting. However, this is not always applicable since some business services do not have online information.
> - Prepare some questions before the meeting.
> - You can also record the session if you prefer. Do not forget to ask for permission beforehand.

#### Step 1.2: Review the available documents

During this step, you will review:
- The documents that the team provided,
- The **Business Service Runbook Template**, and
- The **Business Service Runbook Creation Tracker**. 

You will go through the available documents with the tracker in mind. You will also have to update the tracker as you review the documents. For more information, refer to [Appendix A: Business Service Runbook Creation Tracker](#appendix-a-business-service-runbook-creation-tracker).

1. Gather and organize all the documentation and reference materials you have obtained. 
2. Review the obtained documents, the latest versions of the business service runbook template, and the runbook creation tracker.
3. Note any questions or clarifications you may have.
4. After reviewing the documents, feel free to contact the team to shed light on your questions and concerns.

>  💡 **Tips**
> 
>  - To keep things organized, it is recommended to create a main folder to store all documents. 
> - You can create a simple spreadsheet to keep track of everything. Feel free to devise a system that works for you.

### Step 2: Gather information

After planning the runbook creation process, you can start the information gathering stage. This phase ensures you have all the documents and information you need to write the first draft of the runbook.

1. Contact the SMEs assigned to specific runbook sections. The Enterprise Architect, for example, should be able to provide the necessary information on the business service's System Architecture.
2. Schedule discovery meetings with the SMEs to obtain or build the necessary information.
3. Schedule meetings with the SMEs until you have all the information.

> 📝 **Notes**
> 
> - The goal of this stage is to have adequate information on all sections of the runbook.
> - For some sections, the SMEs may take longer to supply the information, especially if it has to be built from scratch. Sometimes, you may have to proceed to the next step even though you still do not have all the data on hand. Rely on your best judgment for this step.

### Step 3: Write

Now that you have obtained all the necessary information, you are ready to write the first draft of the business service runbook.

1. Add the information to the appropriate sections of the runbook.
2. Research as needed to craft a narrative and piece all the information together into a cohesive whole.
    
> 📝 **Notes**
> 
> - The information from the SMEs may come in the form of diagrams, images, incomplete write-ups, summaries, presentations, and so on. Your responsibility is to fill in the gaps, provide contexts and explanations, and make everything easily understood by your target audience.
> - During the writing stage, you may need to consult the Business Analyst, Software Developers, or SMEs to clarify certain information or confirm your understanding. 
> - When in doubt, do not hesitate to ask questions. Doing this early on can help you down the road. 

### Step 4: First review

The runbook is ready for initial review after writing the first draft. Specifically, the assigned team and the SMEs need to review the runbook draft for clarity, consistency, and accuracy.

1. Send the first draft to the team and the SMEs. 
2. Give them a deadline to go over the document.
3. They should return the document with their comments and feedback.
    
>💡 **Tips**
> 
> - It is highly recommended to schedule a meeting with the team and the SMEs so they can discuss their feedback and the changes you need to incorporate.
> - Having all the involved individuals in one meeting will allow them to ask questions to each other. The Business Analyst and Software Developers, for example, can 
> - If there is a lot of ground to cover, you may need to schedule a series of meetings.
>  - As always, take copious notes. Record the sessions if necessary.

### Step 5: Revise and edit

During this stage, you should revise and edit the first draft of the runbook based on the feedback and comments you received.

### Step 6: Second review

After revising and editing, the second draft must be reviewed by the (1) assigned team and the (2) SMEs. 

1. Send the second draft to the team and the SMEs. 
2. Give them a deadline to go over the document.
	2.1 If they are satisfied with the document, you can proceed to [Step 7: Test](#step-7-test).      
	2.2 If not, they should return the document with their comments and feedback.   
3. Repeat the previous step until they are satisfied with your output.

### Step 7: Test

Once approved, it is time for the operators to test the runbook's clarity, accessibility, and usability. 

An effective business service runbook should allow the operators to carry out various procedures smoothly. The steps should be clear and easy to follow. The runbook should also contain all the additional information they need to perform their tasks.

1. Send a copy of the runbook to the operators. 
2. Give them a deadline to test the runbook.
3. Once the operators are done testing the runbook, schedule a call or meeting with them.
4. During the meeting, ask for their input on the runbook and their overall experience using it.
	4.1 If the operators are satisfied with the runbook, you can proceed to [Step 8: Approve](#step-8-approve).   
	4.2 If not, proceed to the following step.   
5. If the operators are not satisfied or you feel that you can still update the draft, revise and edit the runbook draft based on the feedback and meeting discussions.
6. Repeat the previous step until the runbook draft is deemed clear, accessible, and usable.

> 📝 **Notes**
>
>- The Application Owner or the Business Analyst should be able to provide you with the names you need. 
> - Take notes during the meeting. 

### Step 8: Approve

After passing the test, you must secure the approval of the application owner, business analyst, and software developer. Have them accomplish the sign-off sheet. If they are still unsatisfied with some parts of the runbook, revise the document until you obtain their approval.

## Next steps

Once the key individuals have accomplished the sign-off sheet, then congratulations. You have successfully carried out your assignment.

Once approved, the business service runbook will officially be handed over to the Release Manager, who is in charge of the deployment stage.

After the runbook has been released to the IT department, the responsibility for updating and maintaining the business service runbook falls to the Application Owner. The team may request writing, editing, and formatting support from you now and then.
