# 👩🏻‍💻 About me

My name is Mary Antonette Tanael. I'm a Technical Writer based in the Philippines. 

I'm highly passionate about the written word. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Creative Writing and have explored different forms of writing, including content writing, blogging, and copywriting. 

However, after years of doing content writing, I wanted to try something new. I decided to rekindle my interest in IT and computer science and pursue technical writing.

I'm actively seeking tech writing opportunities where I can leverage my writing skills and passion for IT.

I'm also a lifelong learner. In my free time, I enjoy reading and learning new things. I'm self-studying Python and trying to learn as much as possible about programming, computer science, and IT. Coding is not only a newfound hobby but also a way for me to gain technical knowledge that may be useful in my future roles.
